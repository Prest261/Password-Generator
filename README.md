When the user clicks the button "Generate Password" a series of prompts are displayed to have the user select the criteria they want in a password. The first prompt is about the length of the password, the user can choose between 8-128 characters. If they don't choose a valid number then the question will reprompt until a valid selection is made. Then the prompts have the user select if they want special characters, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and numeric characters. The user can select any or all of the character sets, but they cannot choose none, they will be reprompted if they choose none. After all the prompts run through and a valid selection is made then a random password is generated based on the length the user selected. The user can copy the password by selecting the text in the input field.
